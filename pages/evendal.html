        <p>While both Evendal and Darrow studied under their grandfather, Sparrow, Darrow studied specifically how the weave of magic interacted with objects and Evendal more general rules of magic. So while Darrow walked the path of artifice, Evendal learned the way of wizardry. Evendal was always a bookish boy, more focused on reading stories than reading the room which was perhaps what led him to learning under grandfather Sparrow. He is especially scrawny for his age and always has been though he doesn't appear quite as gaunt as Darrow after Darrow's “incident”. Evendal never played the social game so he doesn't have much real support in court circles but was picked up by Darrow due to his neutrality in this growing contest of succession. Evendal's appearance is average even for a regular member of the kingdom making him well below average for a member of the court. He is quite direct and often misses social cues. What he lacks in social prowess he makes up for in wit, having helped Darrow occasionally with some of his smaller projects with documentation and calculations. Evendal has been interested in the strange and the magical for as long as he can remember so when he heard rumors of a place called Denny's that seems to exist in every kingdom without any perceived connections beyond the name, materials, and inexplicable magics; he was very interested and begged Darrow to visit the nearest Denny's with him.</p>
        <h3>Evendal's Arcane Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            Having learned of the Weave from Sparrow, Evendal became fascinated and enraptured with the idea of casting spells and learning the secrets of magic. He searched through the libraries of the different noble families when his family went out to visit and meet them. He eventually found a spell that he thought would be simple to learn without much risk: Encode Thoughts. His experiments with the spell were unfruitful at first but after a while he was able to draw his thoughts and memories out of his mind. Unfortunately this led to some memory loss when he first got the spell working. After another 2 weeks of troubleshooting, he was able to solve this issue as well.
            Once he was sure he had succeeded, he went straight to Sparrow to show him what he'd accomplished. When he tried to show his grandfather he realized that he couldn't unless his grandfather knew Encode Thoughts or Detect Thoughts (Sparrow did not know either).
            Emboldened by his success, Evendal began studying and learning more spells and eventually joined the Order of Scribes. Following the instructions from the order Evendal managed to awaken sentience in his spellbook. Arvill, is a snarky know-it-all, disappointed to be carried around by an 18 year old fledgling wizard.
