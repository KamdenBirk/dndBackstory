        <h1>Evendal</h1>
        <p>While both Evendal and Darrow studied under their grandfather, Sparrow, Darrow studied specifically how the weave of magic interacted with objects and Evendal more general rules of magic. So while Darrow walked the path of artifice, Evendal learned the way of wizardry. Evendal was always a bookish boy, more focused on reading stories than reading the room which was perhaps what led him to learning under grandfather Sparrow. He is especially scrawny for his age and always has been though he doesn’t appear quite as gaunt as Darrow after Darrow’s “incident”. Evendal never played the social game so he doesn’t have much real support in court circles but was picked up by Darrow due to his neutrality in this growing contest of succession. Evendal’s appearance is average even for a regular member of the kingdom making him well below average for a member of the court. He is quite direct and often misses social cues. What he lacks in social prowess he makes up for in wit, having helped Darrow occasionally with some of his smaller projects with documentation and calculations. Evendal has been interested in the strange and the magical for as long as he can remember so when he heard rumors of a place called Denny’s that seems to exist in every kingdom without any perceived connections beyond the name, materials, and inexplicable magics; he was very interested and begged Darrow to visit the nearest Denny’s with him.</p>
