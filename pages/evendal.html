                    <tr><td>Mind Sliver</td><td>You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</td><td>Psychic</td><td>1d6</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Encode Thoughts</td><td>You pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary. <br>
                    If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand. <br>
                    Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Chill Touch</td><td>You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</td><td>Necrotic</td><td>1d8</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Unseen Servant</td><td>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. <br>
                    Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. <br>
                    If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Catapult</td><td>Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by 1d8, for each slot level above 1st.</td><td>Bludgeoning</td><td>3d8</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ice Knife</td><td>You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of the point where the ice exploded must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</td><td>Piercing/Cold</td><td>1d10/2d6</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Cause Fear</td><td>You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the spell ends. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Snare</td><td>While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach. When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap. <br>
                    The trap is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. <br>
                    The trap triggers when a Small creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell. The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is restrained. <br>
                    The restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the restrained effect on a success. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the restrained creature can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect also ends.</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Sleep</td><td>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). <br>
                    Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Burning Hands</td><td>As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. <br>
                    The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</td><td>Fire</td><td>3d6</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Witch Bolt</td><td>A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.</td><td>Lightning</td><td>1d12</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Detect Thoughts</td><td>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected. <br>
                    You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that loom s large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. <br>
                    Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. <br>
                    You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language. <br>
                    Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Mind Spike</td><td>You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you. <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</td><td>Psychic</td><td>3d8</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Enlarge/Reduce</td><td>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. <br>
                    If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. <br>
                    Enlarge. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage. <br>
                    Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr>

        <p>While both Evendal and Darrow studied under their grandfather, Sparrow, Darrow studied specifically how the weave of magic interacted with objects and Evendal more general rules of magic. So while Darrow walked the path of artifice, Evendal learned the way of wizardry. Evendal was always a bookish boy, more focused on reading stories than reading the room which was perhaps what led him to learning under grandfather Sparrow. He is especially scrawny for his age and always has been though he doesn't appear quite as gaunt as Darrow after Darrow's “incident”. Evendal never played the social game so he doesn't have much real support in court circles but was picked up by Darrow due to his neutrality in this growing contest of succession. Evendal's appearance is average even for a regular member of the kingdom making him well below average for a member of the court. He is quite direct and often misses social cues. What he lacks in social prowess he makes up for in wit, having helped Darrow occasionally with some of his smaller projects with documentation and calculations. Evendal has been interested in the strange and the magical for as long as he can remember so when he heard rumors of a place called Denny's that seems to exist in every kingdom without any perceived connections beyond the name, materials, and inexplicable magics; he was very interested and begged Darrow to visit the nearest Denny's with him.</p>
        <h3>Evendal's Arcane Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            Having learned of the Weave from Sparrow, Evendal became fascinated and enraptured with the idea of casting spells and learning the secrets of magic. He searched through the libraries of the different noble families when his family went out to visit and meet them. He eventually found a spell that he thought would be simple to learn without much risk: Encode Thoughts. His experiments with the spell were unfruitful at first but after a while he was able to draw his thoughts and memories out of his mind. Unfortunately this led to some memory loss when he first got the spell working. After another 2 weeks of troubleshooting, he was able to solve this issue as well.
            Once he was sure he had succeeded, he went straight to Sparrow to show him what he'd accomplished. When he tried to show his grandfather he realized that he couldn't unless his grandfather knew Encode Thoughts or Detect Thoughts (Sparrow did not know either).
            Emboldened by his success, Evendal began studying and learning more spells and eventually joined the Order of Scribes. Following the instructions from the order Evendal managed to awaken sentience in his spellbook. Arvill, is a snarky know-it-all, disappointed to be carried around by an 18 year old fledgling wizard.
