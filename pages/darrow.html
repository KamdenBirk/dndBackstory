        <h1>Darrow</h1>
        <p>Youngest son of Evendur and his wife Miri, Darrow has always been the odd one when it comes to his “trueblood” siblings. While Evendur II and Isobell quickly began obsessing over succession and business and societal connections Darrow instead focused on his hobby of tinkering with anything he could get his hands on. This hobby of his, along with his discovered arcane connection led Darrow to being taught personally by his Grandfather Sparrow von Greycastle, much to the dismay of Evendur II and Isobell. Under his tutelage Darrow quickly became an artificer and now works often with the engineering project under Sparrow’s direction. His half brother Evendal is also under the tutelage of their grandfather, albeit his magical acuity is far more versatile than Darrow’s. With succession upcoming, Darrow sought to avoid making enemies of his siblings by forming a neutral bloc, siblings who would support neither Evendur II or Isobel for successor to their father. Currently the only other member of this bloc is Evendal, who like Darrow himself doesn’t want to pick a side. While unlike his other two full blooded siblings, Darrow isn’t particularly well liked or hated by either the mercantile houses or the noble houses, instead he has a great amount of support from the workers and the old guard within the Greycastle house due to his connection to and work with Sparrow von Greycastle.</p>
        <h2>The Disappearance of Darrow Von Greycastle</h2>
        <p>With the issue of succession growing ever closer, Darrow was growing increasingly worried for the safety of himself and his siblings. He brought this issue up with his grandfather Sparrow a few weeks before Sparrow’s death where Sparrow recounted a legend he had heard in his youth about a magical chalice created by the gods, which was supposed to grant immeasurable power upon the consumption of the mysterious liquid inside the chalice. Since then Darrow has been using what connections he has to search for this mysterious chalice, and after five years of searching he has finally found the likely location of the chalice. His search for the chalice had been kept a secret from everyone but his sibling Evendal, who had often helped Darrow in deciphering other languages and dealing with arcane issues when they presented themselves during the search. With the location of the chalice identified, Darrow put together a small team of adventurers in order to brave the dungeon the chalice inhabits. <br><br>
        The dungeon was found in the frontier, eerily close to the location of Sparrow’s hometown, inside a large cave system. The inside of the dungeon appeared to be a sort of old temple building deep within the earth. The temple consisted of a massive web of tunnels that eventually culminated into a grand offering room. Darrow, seeking to not garner attention from his siblings, kept the raid to a minimum of ten adventurers including himself. They battled all the way through the tunnels, defeating ambushes of giant spiders and avoiding poisonous traps, and eventually only three adventurers and Darrow remained alive as they entered the final offering chamber. In the middle stood their prize, a silver chalice ordained with blood red gemstones with a perpetually swirling red liquid inside. After thoroughly checking the room for traps with the help of the remaining three adventurers Darrow approached the chalice and started preparing the ritual needed to be able to gain the power invested within it. After dropping several ingredients for the ritual into the chalice the liquid inside started to bubble and the room’s edges began to darken. Following the instructions he and Evendal translated from ancient text, Darrow used a sacrificial dagger to slice his hand and give blood as an offering into the chalice. With this sacrifice an explosion in arcane energy began from the chalice and flooded the room. Swirling clusters of dark red energy quickly formed a circle around Darrow and the chalice. The arcane whirlwind was increasing in intensity quickly as the cleric they brought with them was quickly being overwhelmed in her pitiful attempt at fighting against the overwhelming dark energy. In order to attempt to save his paid adventurers, Darrow quickly took the chalice into his hand and drank the liquid inside, with the chalice now empty the arcane whirlwind calmed. With victory at hand the four remaining party members all quickly celebrated a successful raid and the three adventurers were all promised bonuses upon their return. <br><br>
        However, as the party began to get ready to leave the chamber a sharp pain ripped through Darrow’s chest. It fell as if all the blood within him was on fire. Blood seemed to pour from his eyes, blinding him. The three adventurers tried to help Darrow, but to Darrow they no longer existed, being reduced to only their cardiovascular system. The last thing Darrow remembered before blacking out was him sinking his teeth into the neck of his former adventurer friend. <br><br>
        When Darrow awoke, he was standing over the eviscerated and bloody corpses of his former friends. Luckily he was found by his trusted half-brother Evendal who prevented him from wandering into the nearest village and massacring the population. Evendal was on the way to hurriedly inform Darrow that they had mistranslated several key portions of the ancient text where they got the ritual process from. After that Darrow has so far not resurfaced publicly, and with the looming succession crisis getting closer pressure is building for the two lost neutral heirs to return.
