        <h1>Isobell</h1>
        <p>The second child and first daughter of Evendur and his wife Miri. She is incredibly Charismatic, and like her brother she is also ambitious. Physically she resembles her mother greatly, and like her mother she shares her ability to sway the hearts and minds of the many noble families the Greycastles are involved with. Due to this she is the desired succession candidate for most of the noble families and is locked in a deep seated rivalry with her older brother for succession. She has built her own support within the heirs by promising Randal and Darvin positions within the company once she becomes head of the Greycastle house. Views the neutral bloc as potential allies against her brother, but is prepared to act swiftly if Evendur is able to sway the bloc to his side.</p>
