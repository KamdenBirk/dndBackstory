        <h1>Evendur II</h1>
        <p>Evendur the younger was the first child of Evendur and his wife Miri. He is a prideful and ambitious child and very much resembles his father. Much like his father he has a keen business sense and is favored by many of the other Mercantile houses as Evendurâ€™s successor. His prideful and arrogant attitude however has alienated himself from many of the other noble houses. He wants the other heirs to respect his authority as eldest and in his mind the rightful successor. His main opponent in the succession crisis is his sister Isobell, who is constantly trying to subvert his attempts at seizing control over the house. He has successfully intimidated or otherwise convinced Estelle and Gorstagg to his side. He views the neutral bloc as a potential threat against his power, as it contains all the support he would need to secure his place, but his attempts at intimidating the two members of the neutral bloc have so far yielded nothing.</p>
