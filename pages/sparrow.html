        <h1>Sparrow von Greycastle- The Founder</h1>
        <p>
            The Greycastle family became prominent around half a century ago, with the founder of the household, one Sir Sparrow von Greycastle. Sparrow rose from relative obscurity as a small owner of a lumber mill in the frontier to head of a famous merchant guild with close ties to the nobility thanks to Sparrow's incredible economic sense. By rapidly expanding his lumber mills he was soon able to gain a monopoly on timber within much of the frontier. Over the next two or so decades Sparrow moved most of his business interest into shipping. Whether it be by land or sea, the Greycastle name is responsible for a large portion of shipments of all kinds of goods across the continent. Sparrow also established several smaller subsidiaries such as Greycaslte textiles, Greycastle construction, and Sparrow's pet project: Greycastle Engineering. <br><br>
            Unfortunately for Sparrow, a stroke in his forties left him with a limp and a tarnished reputation (as the stroke took place at the King's young son's birthday party). With this Sparrow was forced to retire publicly from his place as head of the Greycastle Mercantile House. Around this time he had also purchased several titles of nobility, placing his family as lesser nobles within the Kingdom. Sparrow gave the reins of his house to his young and only son, Evendur von Greycastle. Sparrow passed away of natural causes five years ago, during his final years he was reported to have been seen training and consorting with two of his grandsons, one Darrow and Evenul von Greycastle, much to the dismay of the other children.
