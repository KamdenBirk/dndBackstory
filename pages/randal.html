        <h1>Randal</h1>
        <p>Randal, first twin of Evendur and his second wife Shandri, is an opportunist at heart. He is always looking for a quick way to secure himself in a household dominated by the three “trueblood” siblings. Displeased with Evendur’s petty intimidation tactics and not seeing any benefit in Darrow’s steadfast neutral stance, he has been naturally drawn to the charismatic Isobell. Together he hopes by siding with Isobell to grant himself and possibly his other siblings safety from the coming succession crisis. He has a particular friendship with his twin Estelle, despite their positions on opposing sides of the succession battle.</p>
