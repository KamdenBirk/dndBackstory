        <h1>Evendur von Greycastle- The Soft-Sword</h1>
        <p>
            Evendur von Greycastle, only son of Sir Sparrow von Greycastle, inherited much of his father's business savvy, without any of his reckless passion. Evendur von Greycastle did not change, he did not innovate, he did not advance the company in any meaningful new direction. Under his leadership house Greycastle became a well respected, yet regularly viewed as dull, lesser noble/mercantile house. While he was not half the innovator his predecessor was, he was twice the father. Evendur is well loved and respected by his kids for his kind treatment of them. He encouraged his kids to pursue their own goals rather than simply follow in his footsteps. He was married twice, once to a lesser noble like himself named Miri, and then a noblewoman from another royal court. His first wife Miri disappeared from public life around three years after the birth of her third child Darrow, while the official story claims she died from a bandit attack while on the way to visit a relative in another city, no body had ever been found and the relative she was going to visit declined every having plans for Miri to come visit her. Despite the odd conditions surrounding the death of his first wife, Evendur quickly remarried. Evendur had three children with his first wife Miri, and five children with his second wife Shandri. At the age of 43 Evendur has contracted a strange disease which has left him sickly and bedridden. Despite the best medical care money can buy, nothing seems to be working to cure his condition. With his death seeming to approach ever closer, and with no will prepared, it will soon come down to his eight children to decide who will succeed their father, and become the next head of the noble house Greycastle.
